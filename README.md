FDTâ€™s SWFBridge is a platform that allows developers to use Actionscript & Flex to create new features and to extend FDT's existing features.

The FDT team strongly believes in transparency, sharing and open source. With these principals in mind, we have open sourced the API of the plugin as well as provided a few demos and examples. We encourage the community to create and share what they build as well as provide us feedback on how it can be better. Due to our Open Source program we can also offer free Max licenses to Open Source FDT PlugIn developers.
